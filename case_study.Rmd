## Load packages and  data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(p8105.datasets)

data(nyc_airbnb)

str(nyc_airbnb)
```


## Brainstorm questions

- Where are airbnbs most expensive?
- How long are airbnbs active?
  - Are airbnbs illegal and do they get shut down?
- Which units have the most availability?
- How is review score impacted by location?
- How many apts are run by one host?
  - Does that affect price?
  - Does that vary by neighborhood?
- Where are airbnbs?
  - Borough? Neighborhood?
  - Lat and long?


## Attempt solutions

1) How is review score impacted by location?
```{r}
nyc_airbnb |>
  group_by(neighbourhood) |>
  summarize(average_review_score = mean(review_scores_location, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```
